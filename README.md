# Retailio
Retailio represents a retail management system commonly used in retail
businesses to manage employees and inventory of the store. It contains a
main method and several helper methods to navigate through the menues. All
methods are private as this is a fully CLI oriented program, and will not be
used or constructed in any outside drivers.

This program is currently a living document that is still in progress.

Future iterations will include encryption of txt files so that they are not
accessible outside of this program, further security for stored objects,
optimized methods to improve time complexity, and potentially POS style
functionality.
